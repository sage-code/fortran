<h1>Syntax Overview</h1>


<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Fortran syntax is original. This language was invented and it inspire other languages with ideas and concepts created by visionary gods of computuer programming. Fortran has set the standard for structured and imperative programming.</div>

<p>Most languages these days are inspired from C, but Fortran was designed before C. It has started a different family of programming languages that use symilar keywords and concepts. Fortran is not a curly bracket language.</p>

<h2>Define Program</h2>

<p>In Fortran, you have to declare the main program using a special keyword that is "program". This can be the only block in the application but is mandatory.</p>

program name_of_program
  ! variable declarations 
  ...
  ! program statements 
  ...
end program
</code></pre>
</div></div>

<h3>Program Name</h3>

<p><em>Notes: </em>You can see the program has a name. Most of the time this name is the same as the file name that is containing the main program. Unfortunately the compiler do not check this and it could be a readability issue. We recommend to use the same name.</p>

<p>Name of program can start with any letter and can contain letters and numbers and underscore. We think the program name should be short but is up to you to give it a significant name. You can name your program "main".</p>

<h3>Line Comments</h3>

<p>In Fortran the comments start with "!" and can be used at beginning of line or at end of line for each statement. Is a good engineering practice to comment your code properly.</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>

</p>Indentation is an equal number of spaces used to align first letter in a statement. Nested statements are indented with equal number of spaces or tabs. We recommand 4 spaces but you can use 2 spaces also. It is a convention you need to establish for each project.</p>

</p>Fortran 77 use to be space sensitive due to punch cards, but Fortran 90 is free form language and is not used with punch carts. The indentation is optional now but recommended. If you make indentation errors, the program will probably compile but is going to be harder to read.</p>

<h2>What is a statement?</h2>

<p>Fortran is a statement oriented language. Every line of code can represent an individual statement. Some statements can include other statements that are nested. This is called a block of code or block statement.</p>

<p>A statement usually start with a keyword and uses one or more expressions. Expressions can contain identifiers, operators, data-literals, function calls and delimiters. An expression that is not used in a statement does not make sense in Fortran.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>Source code is usually stored in a file. This has extension "f" or "f90" or "f95". Is depending on syntax version and compiler you are using. I recommand to use only "f95" version for this course.</p>

<p>The source code can represent a program or a program module. You can compile the source code into an executable object file. After you create several object files, you can link them together into an executable file.</p>

<p>Every source file can contain: declarations, statements or subprograms. Usually the main program is at the bottom in a source file. You can use only one main program for an application.</p>

<h2>Hello World</h2>

<p>Let's make the first example. This example is a little bit simplified to sho you how everything works together. In the console we compile the program and then we run it.</p>


<!--two columns pattern-->
<div class="row">
<!-- first column -->
<div class="column col-md-6 panel">
<div class="panel-heading">main.f95</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<pre class="code-panel">
<code class="language-fortran">!simple program
program main
  implicit none
  character (len = 20) :: name1, name2
  print *, 'Who are you? :'
  read *, name1, name2
  print *,"Hello ",name1," ",name2
end program
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<!-- second column -->
<div class="column col-md-6 panel">
<div class="panel-heading">console</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<pre class="code-panel">
<code class="language-output">~&gt;gfortran ./main.f95 -o main
~&gt;./main
 Who are you? :
Elucian Moise
 Hello Elucian Moise

<p><em>Note: </em>Code examples are available on GitHub. This is an open source project. We run examples online on replit.com. Some of the examples will be available for you to modify, compile and run.</p>

<p><em>Homework: </em>Log-in to <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replit.com</a>, and create your won example. Do not use copy paste. Instead, try to type the code line by line. You will get use with the syntax this way. I hope it works!</p>
