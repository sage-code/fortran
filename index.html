<h2>What is Fotran?</h2>


<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Fortran is 3'rd generation statically typed high performance programming language that is focusing on performance. It is one of the oldest language that is in use today. Fortran design was started by John Backus in 1940s and is powering the world since 1956.</div>

<h2>Fortran status</h2>

<p>Fortran is mature and under active development. The latest revision of the language is Fortran 2018. The next revision, is planned for release in 2023. A standard library and a package manager are currently work in progress and active as open source projects.</p>

<h2>Video Lecture</h2>

<p>Fortran is available as one of GNU compilers. You can watch an introduction to Fortran 95 in this beautiful video tutorial on YouTube. A single video containing an entire book. Give it a try before reading the text articles.

<h2><a id="lang-index"></a>High Level Overview</h2>

<p>Fortran is a solid language implemented by various organizations for specific microprocesors. Each compiler has particular extended features but most compilers support a common standard. Intel is making two comercial compilers: C and Fortran. For teaching Fortran we are using GNU GCC, that is a powerful, open source compiler.</p>

<h2><a id="lang-index"></a>What is wrong with it?</h2>

<p>Fortran is not my favorite language. It is too verbose and has a strange syntax compared to modern languages. Fortran is an imperative programming language. It uses structured programming paradigm (SP) and has no notion of objects. It has functions but is using a static scoping model and does not support high order functions. Also does not have direct support for Unicode. But most annoing is the error management during compilation but also during execution fo the program. Sometimes the compiler error messages are nowere close to the real failure. Fortran do not have try...catch blocks! </p>

<h2><a id="lang-index"></a>Learning Fortran</h2>

<p>You can contribute to articles if you are one of Sage-Code developers. Join Discord and talk to us. We need volunteers. You can learn Fortran and contribute to our website in the same time. Someone is already working on this but you can help. Join our open source community.</p>
